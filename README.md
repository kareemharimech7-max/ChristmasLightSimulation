# Christmas Lights Simulation

This repository contains a simple script to simulate a string of blinking Christmas lights using Python and Turtle graphics.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A terminal that supports Turtle graphics (for GUI simulation)

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
3. No additional dependencies required; Python's standard library is sufficient.

---

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory as the `Mistral.py` script.
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   python Mistral.py
   ```
3. A window will appear showing a string of colored circles representing Christmas lights, blinking and cycling through festive colors.
4. Press `Ctrl + C` or close the window to stop the simulation.

## Customization

- **Number of Lights:** Change the value of `num_lights` in the script to adjust how many bulbs appear.
- **Blink Delay:** Adjust the `time.sleep()` value in the code to make the lights switch colors faster or slower.
- **Colors:** Modify the `colors` list to use your favorite festive colors.

## Example

```powershell
python Mistral.py
```

Sample output (the actual colors will be vivid in the Turtle graphics window):

    [Christmas lights blinking in a window]
